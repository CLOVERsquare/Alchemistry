# Alchemistry 1.19.2-2.0.8 RELEASE

This update brings a bunch of under the hood changes. As for playing the mod, you shouldn't notice any differences.

Changes:
- Update to 1.19.2
- Update ChemLib
- Update Forge
- Changes to machine textures and models that are nicer; we will probably continue to make small changes over time.
- Rewrite JEI transfer handlers. They don't delete items anymore. Also added a transfer handler for the dissolver.
- Add IngredientStack for recipes to hold Ingredients with counts. All recipes excluding for the reactors and atomizer now take an Ingredient input.
- Add functionality to recipe providers for conditional recipes (for mod support) and for all recipes to take tags for input (also for mod support).
- Add dissolver recipes for compound dusts.
