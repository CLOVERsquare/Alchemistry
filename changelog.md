# Alchemistry 1.18.2-2.0.4 RELEASE

We've finally made it to a release! As far as we're aware, there aren't too many outstanding bugs. I hope it stays that way, but realistically, there could be bugs that we just don't know about yet. Please report anything you find so that we can get to work on fixing it asap.

Changes:
- Add Patchouli book entries to help players understand how the mod works.
- Add all of the missing recipes (some more stuff might have been missed so let us know).
- Add zh_cn (Chinese) localization. Thanks ArgonCrystal!
- Add new logo and description in mods.toml.
- Fix a bug with the dissovler in jei where there is only one output not showing anything.
