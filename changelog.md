# Alchemistry 1.18.2-2.1.1 RELEASE

It seems that the last update was pushed out just a little too early. Some people reported a bug with the Dissolver when trying to extract items. This should fix that. But we also added compatibility for dissolving Thermal resources!

Bug Fixes:
- Fix Dissolver block causing a crash when you extract items with a pipe.

Changes:
- Tag all Chemlib recipes in the dissolver. 
- Add compatibility for Thermal resources using the Dissolver.
