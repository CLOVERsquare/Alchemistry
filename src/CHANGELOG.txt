0.8.17
==
-Fixed bug where the combiner recipe would change to the bottom recipe on the JEI page if you didn't select any recipe
-Dissolver recipes with multiple rolls will be outputted much more efficiently/quickly now
(output stacks will be merged if possible, for example, if you have 20 rolls of 100% [2x Stone] with a dissolver speed of 8,
then it will be outputted in 5 ticks rather than 20)


0.8.16
==
-Removed invar dissolver recipes for now
-Removed the duplicate combiner charcoal recipe
-Emeralds <-> Beryl changed from 16 to 8
-Slightly better dissolver output for nether bricks

0.8.15
===
-Fixed machine energy capacity configs again, so this time they should /actually/ work for pre-existing machines, not only newly placed ones

-Updated ru_ru.lang (thanks again to kellixon)

0.8.9
==

-The dissolver now should be smart about how it stacks its output. It will try to stack with existing stacks if possible
before moving to empty slots
-Added an evaporator recipe for Lava -> Magma blocks, allowing the Dissolver to be built before going to the Nether, and thus
allowing the obsidian breaker to be made before going to the Nether as well.
-Tweaked a few miscellaneous machine recipes


0.8.8
==

-The Evaporator now renders fluids in-world(!)


0.8.2
==
-The Chemical Combiner now has a custom JEI transfer handler (the [+] button).
-It no longer transfers items, but it *does* instantly set the recipe template
This has a few side effects:
 * Better performance due to some internal refactoring
 * Setting combiner recipe templates no longer makes you want to rip your hair out, as all it takes is a single click in JEI
 * The Combiner will not function without JEI now (but who played without JEI anyway?)
 * The CraftTweaker 'Combiner.removeRecipe' handler now takes an output instead of a list of inputs
 * Recipe clashes (with same ingredients in same slots, but different quantities) are no longer an issue

-The blocks with custom models should now have normal sized in-world items
-All fluids with the name of elements (oxygen, hydrogen, [molten] iron, etc.) now have recipes in the atomizer
to convert modded fluids into element items. The liquifier now has all of these recipes reversed as well
-Few other little things


0.7.10
==
-Custom XML recipes will now be loaded from all .xml files in the /config/alchemistry directory. Previously only custom.xml was allowed.
-Added a fertilizer item, which essentially functions the same as vanilla bonemeal, but is acquired a different way
