0.8.8
==
-Added elements 110-118 (some of which didn't even have names when I started making this mod!)
-Fixed buggy Dissolver output probably caused by v0.8.4

0.8.7
==
-Fixed crafttweaker Dissolver removeRecipe bug introduced in 0.8.5 for oredict entries
-Added basic log messages for all crafttweaker recipes


0.8.6
==
-The Liquifier/Atomizer metal recipes are now normalized with other mods i.e. 1 ingot = 16 chem items = 144mb
 to prevent item duplication with a mod like Tinkers


0.8.5
==
-Fixed tile break particles for all tiles
-Fixed Atomizer working without power
-Fixed ghost/invalid recipes in Dissolver JEI
-Added a new CT function to fetch elements/compounds rather than needing to look up the meta value


0.8.4
==
-Tile performance improvement

0.8.3
==
-Updated ru_ru.lang, again thanks to kellixon
-Minor tweaking of the Combiner JEI display
-The Evaporator now renders fluids in-world(!)


0.8.2
==
-The Chemical Combiner now has a custom JEI transfer handler (the [+] button).
-It no longer transfers items, but it *does* instantly set the recipe template
This has a few side effects:
 * Better performance due to some internal refactoring
 * Setting combiner recipe templates no longer makes you want to rip your hair out, as all it takes is a single click in JEI
 * The Combiner will not function without JEI now (but who played without JEI anyway?)
 * The CraftTweaker 'Combiner.removeRecipe' handler now takes an output instead of a list of inputs
 * Recipe clashes (with same ingredients in same slots, but different quantities) are no longer an issue

0.8.0
==
-Fixed XML bug with Chem Dissolver input not working with the 'quantity' attribute
-Added JEI transfer handlers (the [+] button) for the Chemical Dissolver, Liquifier, and Electrolyzer
-Alloy recipes should be fixed now (before they could generate more resources than they took to make)
-Added a few micellaneous machine recipes
-Machines should no longer assume a stack size of 64 for all items
-Added basic CraftTweaker support for all machines(!)

0.7.15
==
-Added a Russian translation, thanks to kellixon on github
-Added tooltips for all of the energy consuming blocks telling how much FE/t they consume as per the configs
-All machines have had a texture/model makeover
0.7.14
==
-The evaporator recipe has been changed to no longer require iron, only stone
-I touched up the mineral salt & fertilizer texture. They still aren't pretty, but they're better
-Added recipes for cactus
-The fertilizer recipe now gives 8 items output instead of 1
-The blocks with custom models should now have normal sized in-world items
-All fluids with the name of elements (oxygen, hydrogen, [molten] iron, etc.) now have recipes in the atomizer
to convert modded fluids into element items. The liquifier now has all of these recipes reversed as well
-Few other little things


0.7.10
==
-Custom XML recipes will now be loaded from all .xml files in the /config/alchemistry directory. Previously only custom.xml was allowed.
-Added a fertilizer item, which essentially functions the same as vanilla bonemeal, but is acquired a different way
-Added miscellaneous chemical compounds, recipes, etc.

If you have any additions or changes you would like to see to the mod then please let me know on the github issue tracker

0.5.1
==
-Added a progress bar for the evaporator
-Added a few more miscellaneous machine recipes
-Trimmed down the jar file size a bit


0.5.0
==
-Added primitive "smart insertion" with recipe locking and machine pausing buttons
 to facilitate automation
-All NBT data (items,energy,fluids,etc) should now be saved properly when any machines are broken
-Electrolyzer can now only use the proper electrolyte, not any ingredient



0.4.1
==
-Added a texture for energy bars
-Added colors for the rest of the current elements and compounds

    would mess with all of the crafting recipes in JEI that had that item
-Added a few miscellaneous recipes
